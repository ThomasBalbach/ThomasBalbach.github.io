I gave an informational session on the PIONEER programme at KU Leuven. The Erasmus Mundus Master of Science in Public Sector Innovation and eGovernance (PIONEER) is a two-year or 120 ECTS joint master programme organised by KU Leuven (Belgium), the University of Münster (Germany) and Tallinn University of Technology (Estonia).
